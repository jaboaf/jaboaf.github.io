Hello Prof Petrovic,

I'm Jojo, a math undergrad at cornell. I am wondering: 
Is there a closed form solution for the beta-model MLE?

Thanks for your help, Jojo
P.s. I wake up every day thinking about algebra in statistics, your work is inspiring.

Hi Jojo,
sorry for the late reply! I'm a bit overcommitted at the moment. 

I believe you are looking for an equation like [system of equations (6) here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.1004.pdf). This paper is about beta-hypegraphs but if you just let every edge be of size 2, you get the beta-model for graphs. 

I hope this is what you are looking for!

p.s. 
In case you'd like to dig in more, check out these resources which look like they are written up fairly concretely:
https://www.stat.umn.edu/geyer/5421/slides/expfam.html
https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2757495/bartz_montecarlo.pdf?sequence=4
The first one gives the general context of exponential families and how to find MLEs there. We know a lot about exponential families.
Here is another post that discusses which families of distributions *may* have closed form solutions:

Hi Professor Saloff-Coste,

Attached is a scan of my project. I will drop off the hard copy at your office later today.

I desire your thoughts and feedback on this ~project~. Would that be possible? You can write directly on the hard copy if you like. Feel free to tear it apart (not in the physical sense), I do not take criticism personally. Positive feedback would also be helpful.

Thank you for the opportunity to do this project (it also helped distract me the past couple of days), I hope you enjoy it. I am sorry that it is not "polished", I was more focused on content.

Sincerely,
Jojo

*hard copy MIA*
asked: do you think math is created or discovered?
answered: uhhh *pause* i'm not sure
*received a 20 minute lecture on that math is discovered and one does not "just create math"*
*thanked Prof. Saloff-Coste for his feedback*

Hi!

(Very separate from my other email) I want your help. These things interest me and you know a lot about them. I think it would be fun to explore and create with you. In particular, the analysis/number theory using roots of 1. (If you think it's all useless that would be good to know, too).

Best,
Jojo
