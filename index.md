I’m Jojo Aboaf; welcome.

Some non-technical facts about me:

-   I started surfing as a 6 year-old and haven’t stopped. As a New-Yorker this
    means bringing a board bad and a wetsuit on the A train to far-rockaway in
    January. People will look at you like you’re crazy.
    
-   I cook a lot and an avid non-follower of recipes. I like to experiment and
    learn about new ingredients, techniques, flavor profiles, cuisines, and
    traditions. And I try not to make the same exact thing twice.

-   I’m a life long dancer. From 1st through 8th grade I focused on ballet. Most
    of my time was at the Joffrey Ballet School where I took on various roles in
    their Annual Nutcracker, including party boy, rat (you get to wear a pillow
    inside your costume), and gingerbread man. There is also a shortage of male
    dancers so I danced for American Ballet Theatre in Le Coursaire at Lincoln
    Center! Every year of high-school, I participated in the school dance
    concert. And I’ve taken salsa classes since going to college.

-   I played baseball since I can remember. I played catcher through freshman
    year of high-school, then I ran winter track for a season, and all of a
    sudden I was fast, life in the outfield is luxurious and I didn’t miss
    lugging my equipment everywhere. Reading fly balls coming off a bat is no
    easy task though.
