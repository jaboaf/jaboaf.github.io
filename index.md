I am jojo. I draw, dance, surf, ski, cook, love, play, experiment, build, ...

... and program. it can be delighting. useful too.
- to obtain data from the internet
- to make pictures depicting data, functions, ...
- building and trying out methods or strategies to answer a question or solve a problem 

most of the time programming, is playing or exploring.

i run a pretty experimental 'shop' so the dress code is fairly casual. i dont mind too much. it does pain me to look back at experiments gone awry, especially reflecting attitudes or characters distracting from or missing certain aspects of the experience. but thats life and how it be regardless of much else. 

ideally, the stuff i share is accessible and digestible and not used for evil or undue detriment; and that i share stuff accessibly and digestibly and not maliciously. alas, 'public' will do.
